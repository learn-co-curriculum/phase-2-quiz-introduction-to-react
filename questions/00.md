# Intro to React

Which of the following describe React as a library? Select all that apply.

## Correct

Declarative

> Correct!
> 
> React uses declarative programming which:
> 
> - Describes&nbsp;_what_&nbsp;a program should accomplish (or what the end result should be)
> - Leaves the determination of&nbsp;_how_&nbsp;to get to the end result up to the program

## Correct

Component-Based

> Yes!
> 
> React encourages us to structure our applications as "components": the building
> blocks of our web page that handle their own data and UI logic, that can be
> "composed" together with other components to put together a complete app.

## Correct

Learn Once, Write Anywhere

> Nice One!
> 
> One great thing about React is that it works in a few different environments.
> Once you learn the key concepts of working with React to create client-side web
> applications, you can also more easily learn&nbsp;[React
> Native](https://reactnative.dev/)&nbsp;and write native mobile apps using React,
> or use tools
> like&nbsp;[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)&nbsp;and&nbsp;[Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/)&nbsp;to
> write server-rendered React.

## Incorrect

A Model-View-Viewmodel Framework

> While you can implement a MVVM architectural pattern in your React program, it
> isn't inherently a MVVM framework.

## Incorrect

I don't know.

> Be sure to study the source/s for this question. You'll get it next time.
