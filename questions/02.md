# Intro to React: Declarative Programming

Match the term with the correct description.

## Correct

- Declarative Programming
- Describes what a program should accomplish (or what the end result should be),
  and leaves the determination of how to get to the end result up to the
  program.

## Correct

- Imperative Programming
- Explicitly describes the actions a program should take, each step of the way,
  and describes how a program should go about doing those actions.

## Incorrect

- Vaguely describes the actions a program should take, allows the programmer to
  write the actions in a separate program if they need or want.
- I don't know.
