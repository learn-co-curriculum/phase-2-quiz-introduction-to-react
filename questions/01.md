# Intro to React: Declarative Programming

Of the code examples below, which uses **declarative** syntax?

## Correct

```jsx
const header = <h1 className="main">Hello from React!</h1>;

ReactDOM.render(header, document.querySelector("#container"));
```

> Correct!
>
> With declarative syntax, we are able to leave the determination of _how_ to
> get to the end result up to the program! Therefore, we _don't_ need to lay out
> every step that needs to happen, like we do with imperative syntax.

## Incorrect

```js
const header = document.createElement("h1");
header.textContent = "Hi!";
header.className = "main";
const container = document.querySelector("#container");
container.append(header);
```

## Incorrect

I don't know.
